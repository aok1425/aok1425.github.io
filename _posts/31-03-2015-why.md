title: Why excluding file extensions in your antivirus is a Really Bad Idea

It is often thought that some file extensions, such as TXT, INI, or LOG always indicate plain text files and cannot do any harm. Here's an example that proves this belief wrong. When bundled with a specially crafted LNK shortcut file as shown below, it becomes easy to persuade a non-savvy into unwillingly executing arbitrary code.

This seems to affect all Windows flavors, and was reported to Microsoft in October 2014, with no response so far. Not sure if this is worthy of a CVE or not. But by all means, do scan ALL your files, regardless of extension!
