title: Why excluding certain file extensions in your antivirus is a Really Bad Idea
comments: true

It is often thought that some file extensions, such as TXT, INI, or LOG always indicate plain text files and cannot do any harm. This leads some people to configure exclusion rules to keep their AV from scanning these files.  

Here's an example that shows why this is dangerous. It consists of a Win32 executable disguised as a TXT file and bundled with a specially crafted LNK shortcut. If sent as an email attachment, non-savvy recipients can easily be tricked into unwillingly executing arbitrary code. (Not sure if this is worthy of a CVE or not?)

This seems to affect all Windows flavors, and was reported to Microsoft in October 2014, with no response so far.  In the meantime, do scan ALL your files, regardless of extension!
