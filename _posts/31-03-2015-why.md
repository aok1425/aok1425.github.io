title: Why excluding file extensions in your Antivirus is a Really Bad Idea
comments: true

It is often thought that some file extensions, such as TXT, INI, or LOG always indicate plain text files and cannot do any harm.
Here's an example that proves this belief wrong. When bundled with a .LNK file as shown below, it becomes easy to persuade a non-savvy into unwillingly executing arbitrary code.
This has been reported to Microsoft in October 2014, with no response so far. So, do scan all your files regardless of extension!
